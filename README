Detailed Specificationsi

Just keepinge app as simple as possible 
No logins or signups
Assumeing that all the grocery items that you create are available to all the users
When I visit a url say url-of-your-app-hosted-on-heroku/create_grocery, a form should be available through which I can create a grocery item. Just have some basic details like Name, price, description, etc.
When I visit a url say url-of-your-app-hosted-on-heroku, I should be able to view all the grocery items that have been created so far. I should be able to buy a grocery item by providing my name and email. Once I feed in my name and email, a session should be created. Each time I buy more items, it would be added to my session
When I visit a url say url-of-your-app-hosted-on-heroku/checkout, I should see the list of items that I have bought, in a table format
As the number of screens are limited, try providing a pleasing UI. Usage of twitter bootstrap would be an added advantage
Use github for source control
